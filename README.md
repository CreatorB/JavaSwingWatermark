#### 1. Introduction
The `JavaSwingWatermark` application is a Java-based GUI program that allows users to add text and image watermarks to images. The application uses Swing components to create a user-friendly interface for selecting images, adding watermarks, and managing the results in a table.

#### 2. Main Components
- **JFrame**: The main window of the application.
- **JPanel**: Used to organize components in a grid layout.
- **JLabel**: Displays text and images.
- **JTextField**: Input field for watermark text.
- **JButton**: Buttons for browsing images, adding data, deleting data, and resetting fields.
- **JTable**: Displays the processed images and their details.

#### 3. Initialization
- The application sets up the main window with a border layout.
- A form panel is created to hold labels, buttons, and input fields for selecting images and watermark text.

#### 4. Image Selection
- Users can browse and select an image source and a watermark image using file choosers.
- The selected images are displayed in labels within the form panel.

#### 5. Adding Watermarks
- The application allows users to add text watermarks to the selected image.
- Users can also add an image watermark, which is resized to one-fourth of the source image size and placed in the center.

#### 6. Managing Data
- Users can add the processed image to a table, which displays the image name, the watermarked image, and a download button.
- The table uses custom cell renderers and editors to handle images and buttons.

#### 7. Table Operations
- The table header is set up with columns for the image name, the watermarked image, and a download button.
- The "Image" column uses a custom cell renderer to center the image within the cell.
- The "Download" column uses a custom cell renderer and editor to display and handle the download button.

#### 8. Button Actions
- **Add Data**: Processes the selected image and adds it to the table.
- **Delete Data**: Removes the selected row from the table.
- **Reset**: Clears all input fields and selected images.

#### 9. Watermark Methods
- **addWatermark**: Adds text watermark to the image.
- **addImageWatermark**: Adds an image watermark to the image after resizing it.

#### 10. Main Method
- The application starts by creating an instance of `JavaSwingWatermark` and setting it to be visible.
